# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
With the use of JavaScript, HTML, D3.js and Plotly, I created an interactive dashboard used to display dataset regarding the bacteria found in human belly buttons. 

## Overview
With a completed panel for demographic information I need to create a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically,volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

I will create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. I will also create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

Lastly, I will create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

With my knowledge of bootstrap and HTML I will customize the webpage for the dashboard.
